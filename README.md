HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of over 10 years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## Features

  research and experimentation by over 200 contributors.
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* Includes:
  * [`Normalize.css`](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
    for CSS normalizations and common bug fixes
  * A custom build of [`Modernizr`](https://modernizr.com/) for feature
    detection
  * [`Apache Server Configs`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache)
